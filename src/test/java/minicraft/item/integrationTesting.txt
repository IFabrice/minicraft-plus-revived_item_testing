Focused integration testing for the modules was not feasible for the following reasons:

1. Modules are naturally highly decoupled: the modules do not depend on each other in any case, and this made it
   impossible to find integration points on which to base our tests on.

2. Integration that focuses on super class was already tested: One possible integration point of the modules is their super classes.
   Initially, we thought of testing the functions in the super class behave similarly in all modules. However, these tests
   are already implemented in white box testing. Therefore, the module has no integration tests.


The available points of integration:
1. Inventory & items
